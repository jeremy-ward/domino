# Domino Power
App that shows the magnifying power of a falling domino

This app uses the theory that a falling domino carries enough potential energy to knock over a domino larger than itself.

Calculates the dimensions of each domino in the sequence and provides objects with comparable dimensions for some of the sizes.
